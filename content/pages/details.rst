Venue
=====

The event will take place on the `main university campus
<https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/52.13985/11.64565>`_ in Magdeburg. While
some details a still in flux, we will have multiple hack rooms with solid
wireless *and* wired network. 


The weather will be great, there is a park right around the corner, and places
to relax and get some fresh air right outside the buildings.

Most importantly, there are at least two dedicated coffee bars that will help
you find the exact type of caffeine source that *you* need to crank out all
that scientific output goodness.


Accomodation
============

Attendees will organize their accommodations individually. Magdeburg offers a
range of places to stay. Here are two affordable options: 

- Hostel: http://www.jugendherberge-magdeburg.de
- B&B: https://www.hotelbb.de/de/magdeburg

If you are a sucker for an opulent breakfast, take a look at the `Maritim
<https://www.maritim.de/de/hotels/deutschland/hotel-magdeburg/unser-hotel>`_,
but you gotta pay the price.


Transportation
==============

While Magdeburg has an airport, most people will want to fly to `LEJ
<https://www.leipzig-halle-airport.de/>`_ or `BER
<http://www.berlin-airport.de>`_ and then take the train to Magdeburg, which
will take between 90min (LEJ) and 2 hours and a bit (BER).

Otherwise, Magdeburg is easy to get to from all directions by `train
<https://www.bahn.de>`_, or by `car <https://www.google.de/maps/dir//Otto-von-Guericke-Universit%C3%A4t+Magdeburg,+Universit%C3%A4tsplatz,+Magdeburg/@52.1401845,11.6418375,17z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x47af5f4e8655c243:0x2aa651e3d67867a6!2m2!1d11.6441991!2d52.1402053>`_ (A2 and A14). 

The main venue and all accommodation options mentioned above are
in walking distance. If you want to get around, there are trams and buses.
